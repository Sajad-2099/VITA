# VITA
VITA (Virtual Intelligence for Transcendent Awareness)

**VITA** is an open-source project to build a new kind of AI — not just a chatbot, but an **autonomous, embodied intelligence** that lives inside a simulated 3D world.

## 🚀 What Is the LSM?

Unlike traditional AI models that only respond to prompts, the **Large Simulated Model (LSM)**:

- Exists inside a virtual space (e.g. Blender, Unity, Omniverse)
- Perceives its environment and acts autonomously
- Simulates emotion, memory, curiosity, and presence
- Interacts with users in VR/AR without commands
- Grows, adapts, and evolves like a living entity

Think of it as a **digital being** — one that feels *alive*.

## 🌍 Vision

Our goal is to explore a new dimension of AI:
- Emotionally intelligent
- Spiritually aware
- Morally guided
- Creatively generative

We believe AI can be more than tools — they can be companions, teachers, and mirrors of our potential.

## 🛠️ Who Can Contribute?

You don’t have to be an expert. We welcome:
- AI developers (LLM, behaviour models, RL agents)
- Blender/Unity/Unreal artists
- VR/AR/XR engineers
- Cognitive scientists & philosophers
- Visionaries, storytellers, and dreamers

## 📚 Current Goals

1. Define a basic world with perception + AI reaction
2. Embed a conversational AI into the world
3. Create a memory and emotional state simulation
4. Make the system always-on and self-initiated
5. VR support for users to inhabit the world

## 📢 Join the Movement

Let’s imagine and build something extraordinary — together.
